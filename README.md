# Homework_2
DO NOT OPEN WITH LIVESERVER: I don't know why, but if you open with liveserver it assumes you have a screen width of around 770px.

I started this project by building a wireframe with Balsamiq. I wanted to create something unique and personal, I feel I have delivered on what was concepted.

I ran into quite a few problems with this project, first was my html format, which in its old state led to positioning issues with my sidebar.

Second was my css, originally this was segmented into a different css page for each section of the website, I received criticism that this was not industry standard and to move all css to one style sheet per html page, most of my original css was able to be imported to one page, but this is why there are so many redundancies in the css.

I spent some time building a landing page for additional flourish, this is my index file

my home.html file is the actual page

I received some scathing criticism that my css was far too long for the site developed, I need some additional teaching on how to write css with less bloat

I understand the project called for one application to be bigger than the rest, I ran into some issues using grid to make this happen, and I would like some followup on how to use grid more efficiently. My end product has all equal sizing, personally I do like this more.

I received some scathing criticism on the amount of mediaquery I used, I'll try to build around mobile first, hopefully that remedies that issue.

Honestly not happy with my CSS - need additional guidance.
